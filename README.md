# Code Formatter (Python)
 
In this project, we aim to build a code formatting model using the `T5-small` architecture, 
trained on the Python subset of the `CodeSearchNet` dataset. The objective is to create a 
sequence-to-sequence model that can learn to automatically format unstructured or poorly 
formatted Python code snippets. Using T5-small allows us to leverage an efficient, transformer-based 
language model to predict proper spacing, line breaks, and indentation, making code more readable 
and maintainable.
